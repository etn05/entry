        <p>Orange County, California: home to Disneyland, scenic beaches, and 3 million people within its 800 square miles. A perfect suburbia, “a bastion of conservatism, affluence, white privilege, and uncontrolled sprawl” (Aguilar, 49); but beyond the palm trees, the oil rigs, and the perfectly planned out cities lies a refuge for a people preserved in time, a Saigon never forgotten, and new generations being born intricately tied to a home that lives solely in the echoes of the past.
            </p>
            <p>Until the 20th century, Orange County was still burgeoning into suburbia propelled by the economic prosperity sparked by the Gold Rush and thriving coastal harbors. During this time, Caucasians with overwhelmingly Republican views predominantly inhabited the area, shaping a political landscape that mirrored their demographic dominance. However, the 1970s brought about a significant transformation as Vietnamese refugees poured into the area, melding the culture of Saigon into Orange County’s own.
            </p>
            <p>With a population of nearly 200,000 Vietnamese Americans, Orange County stands as the largest community of ethnically Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam itself. Within it lies Little Saigon, a semblance of Vietnamese culture and heritage within the intricate social fabric of Southern California. The enclave serves as a testament to the resilience and dedication exhibited by Vietnamese refugees who sought to create a home in America. But, how did Little Saigon come to be? And how will a town so rooted in the past adapt to the aspirations of its new generations?</p>

                <p>First, it is important to distinguish the dichotomy between “refugees” and “immigrants.” Immigrants, guided by choice, make a conscious journey to leave their homes and establish a life in a foreign land. Yet, refugees find themselves forced to abandon their homes driven away by the ravages of persecution, violence, or war. Their inability to return home often necessitates placemaking in the land they seek refuge in. My family, the people of Little Saigon, are refugees. </p>

            <p>Following South Vietnam’s defeat in a ten-year civil war that America insisted on fighting in, a mass exodus of 130,000 refugees ensued. Driven by a fear of the new Việt Cộng rule, Vietnamese southerners and northern migrants evacuated prior to April 30, 1975. It was on this particular day that a bomb befell my family’s town, Vung Tau, prompting their narrow escape on a fishing boat my grandmother’s cousin crafted. After a day of aimless sailing, they eventually approached an American military ship that harbored thousands of other Vietnamese escapees. Shortly after, they were taken to Guam where they spent a month awaiting approval of their citizenship until they were relocated to Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania. This is an enduring narrative beholden to each of our family’s histories within the Vietnamese diaspora, one that enshrines escapes on fishing boats and a convergence in the makeshift tent cities of Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania, Camp Pendleton in California, Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, or the Eglin Air Force in Florida. These stories have left an indelible mark on the Vietnamese-American identity, inextricably uniting us through the shared hardships that characterize the foundation of our lives in America. </p>
            <p>Despite the fleeting nature of these tented circumstances, refugees managed to cultivate a sense of community by organizing religious services, publishing poetry, attending music concerts, and, in true Vietnamese fashion, schedule dozens of wedding parties (Nguyen, 2015). For Orange County in particular, the community they formed in the transient campsite laid the foundation for the large ethnic enclave the area is today. In the 1970s Orange County was “still a suburban metropolis in the making” with a population comprising of 1,421,233, who were nearly all white (Nguyen, 2015). Despite the widespread conservative political views and economic instability of the time, the Orange County Register wrote that they “must accommodate [Vietnamese refugees], absolutely must;” and that despite the anticipated strain on the struggling job market, it was necessary to consider the “moral imperative.” At the end of the day, what more could these guilt-ridden white Americans do for the South Vietnamese refugees after they had failed to “protect” them from communism?</p>
            <p>Seventy-five percent of Vietnamese refugees found shelter in America through faith-based organizations. Among them were my own family, who settled within a Catholic Church situated in rural Pennsylvania. In Lykens, a town where people of color were seldom seen, a community took it upon themselves to teach my family— entirely unfamiliar with American customs— English, offer them factory jobs, and assist in their assimilation. Vietnamese refugees were notably granted entrance into America off of a moral obligation, not a legal one, so churches and communities like these constructed a sort of moral shield to foster these individuals.</p>
            <p>While small Vietnamese communities emerged outside of Southern California, none were as centralized as that of Orange County’s. With the churches’ efforts in uniting families, almost twenty thousand Vietnamese refugees had been resettled all over Southern California by the end of 1975.</p>
            <p>Over time, Little Saigon experienced remarkable growth as people sought out familiar food, homes, and a general sense of belonging in Orange County. The emergence of numerous Asian-owned businesses played a crucial role in revitalizing Orange County's once-struggling economy. Before long, Little Saigon was officially recognized as a “Special Tourist Zone” in June of 1988 at Phước Lộc Thọ, the iconic Asian Garden Mall built the previous year. Various cultural mediums emerged, with newspapers, radios, and television facilitating connectivity within the Vietnamese community. Subsequently, the population had grown exponentially with other first-wave refugees coming from across the states and directly from Southeast Asia (Nguyen, 2015). With all of these new developments, a lost city had been resurrected.</p>
            <p>My mother was among this vanguard of first-wave refugees who flocked to Orange County. Her pronounced disconnect from her white peers in Pennsylvania compelled her to spend summers in California in pursuit of a community she could call her own. Ultimately, she found herself in Little Saigon after graduating college, guided by her long-held desire to be a part of the larger Vietnamese collective. Soon the rest of our family joined her.</p>

             <h2> Nằm Trong Vòng Vai Sài Gòn Mới <br>
                What Lies in the Arms of a New Saigon</h2>

                <p>From an American’s view, it seemed convenient to label Vietnamese people as “model minorities” who climbed the socioeconomic ladder. However, this title glaringly dismisses the significant challenges the refugees faced. Illustrative of the resourceful tactics and perhaps desperate measures Vietnamese people employed as victims of war, the community often exploited California’s social welfare system to secure medicine and housing for their families. While it might seem misleading, the refugees exhibited resilience and determination in ensuring the survival and protection of their families, navigating a complex system while grappling with the challenges of adapting to a new life in a foreign land. Traumatized, displaced from the homeland, and confronting the challenges of a new one, leveraging social benefits and trying to conform to American ideals was the best they could do to survive.</p>

                <p>To grasp the cultural context into which these refugees were thrust, it’s crucial to discern the dual sentiments of guilt and gratitude that permeated both American and Vietnamese refugees during the 70s. The Vietnamese were desperate to assimilate and compensate for their loss in a war that had cost Americans much of their highly valued prestige. At the same time, the Americans felt they had the aforementioned “moral responsibility” to take in these war-torn Southeast-Asian victims. In light of these muddled feelings, Vietnamese people eagerly embraced the title of being a “model minority.” Yet, the identity of the Vietnamese-American community transcends that of serving as mere conduits in the pervasive Red Scare mindset embedded in the American consciousness.</p>
                <p>Today the older population of Little Saigon continues to uphold conservative views, presumably influenced by the community that received them years before and the country they left to the blight of a communist regime. Much of Vietnamese-American media still employs fear-mongering tactics against any socialist policies, influencing the susceptible and afflicted older generation to perpetuate principles that inadvertently overlook the future of Little Saigon.</p>
                <p>As a new generation characterized by an increased American influence, higher education, and greater optimism emerges in Little Saigon, these established notions encounter a progressive reassessment. Today, as we, the Vietnamese diaspora in Little Saigon, navigate the American experience, we confront our desire to forge an authentic identity beyond the American perceptions that categorize us as “model minorities” and weapons against communism as “Vietnamese-Americans.”</p>
                <p>In a sense, Little Saigon is a resin-cast embodiment of 1970s Saigon—a place frozen in time, untouched by war. When I speak of Little Saigon dwelling in the past, it is this time of pre-70s Vietnam. We, the people of Little Saigon, are characterized by a unique combination of being newly American and Vietnamese people of the 70s. Our ideas, fashion, and even our language are confined to those bygones, distinctly diverging from today’s “Ho Chi Minh.” We cannot return to Vietnam and be called “Vietnamese.” Instead, we are “Việt Kiều,” foreigners in our own country. Thus, with the emergence of Little Saigon, a new collective identity emerges, one that encapsulates us all as “Vietnamese-Americans,” bridging the past with the present in a reflection of our shared heritage and journey. Little Saigon is not just a place; it is a testament to resilience, to the enduring spirit of a people who have forged a new home while carrying the remnants of their old one within them. It is a space where the past is not just preserved, but celebrated, where the struggles of the older generation are honored and their stories are woven into the fabric of our daily lives. However, in embracing this heritage, we’re tasked with navigating a delicate balance of negating the perpetuation of war trauma while, yes, preserving our past, but also accounting for our future.</p>
                <p>Growing up, I wanted to escape the confines of Little Saigon, I yearned for an upbringing like my mother’s— one surrounded by white people, the “real Americans.” Nestled within its little bubble, it wasn’t until I ventured out of Orange County that I realized how much it meant to me, how much it means to all of us. Little Saigon exudes a sense of being sheltered by design; it stands as a tangible refuge meticulously constructed to mirror a land we once called home. In hindsight, it becomes evident that our migration to Little Saigon was driven by our shared pursuit of community. Even today, my strongest connections are fostered in Orange County where our narratives intertwine, weaving similar stories of heritage and experience. Our parents, who arrived on fisher’s boats, incessantly remind us of their arduous journey to America; as remediation, we devoted our childhoods to praising God for the blessings He bestowed upon our families and diligently pursuing the education that eluded our parents. Although I was afforded the privilege of a “fully American” childhood, I still find profound solace in the embrace of Little Saigon and its people. The bumpy roads, the aromatic Pho shops, the solemnity of the churches we frequent, the Vietnamese signage you couldn’t find anywhere else in America, the distinct, if somewhat jarring to an outsider, cadence Vietnamese people converse in— it all means home to me. Even when visiting Vietnam itself, the indisputable belonging I searched for escaped me; instead, it revealed itself in Little Saigon. There, a unique culture unfurls— a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, labor, and love.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, there would be no Orange County without Little Saigon, without the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees whose efforts not only forged a home in America but also bestowed California with a cultural history that is an indelible part of its identity.</p>
                <p>I urge the children like me, those who inherited the legacies of our parents —both the burdens of trauma and the blessings of love—to champion the memory of Little Saigon. As the scatterings of the “American” war fade and we depart from our ông bà, it becomes our responsibility to nurture the sanctuary they ardently built. Though we cannot linger in the past that our elders might, we will safeguard the essence of places like Little Saigon, defining what it means to be Vietnamese-American without forsaking our roots for the “American dream,” but instead fulfilling our own.</p>
