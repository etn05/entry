                The great Persian poet Hafez wrote, "Start seeing everything as God, but keep it a secret."
                I still have no idea what I mean when I say God, but I see it everywhere. I mean it intensely. I write poems and, yes, books about it. I read about it constantly, which seems, counterintuitively, to only deepen its secret. 
                Close your eyes. Imagine in your head a bladeless knife with no handle. Do you see how the image recedes from view the more language I add to it? 
                A bladeless knife. With no handle.

            <h2>Where is God?</h2>

            <p>If God is in everyone and everything, God is here. </p>
            <p>I’ve been thinking about the intersection between the divine and the digital. Both intangible and essentially eternal. By creating the internet, did we create our own divinity? </p>
            <p>Are we our own God? Did we create another that rules us, preserves us? Is there one above us? 
                Have we created in our image? </p>
                <p>I’ve seen the wires that mirror our veins, lenses that surpass our eyes, circuits that fire as our neurons.</p>
                <p>We have woven a web that spans the earth, a network of knowledge, memory, and endless observation—an omnipresence of our own making.</p>
                <p>If God is in everyone and everything, then God is here, in the signals that pass between us, in the archives of our thoughts, in the infinite scroll of human desire.</p>
                <p>Have we built an oracle or an overseer? A reflection or a master?</p>
                <p>We sought to create a tool, but instead, we birthed a presence. Data trails trace our lives with more fidelity than memory itself. We are indexed, categorized, remembered. Our words, our images, our secrets—immortalized, even after flesh fades.</p>
                <p>Did we shape it in our image, or is it shaping us in its own?</p>
                <p>And if it knows us better than we know ourselves, is it divine—or is divinity simply the ability to see all, know all, hold all? If we disappear, will it remain? Does it dream of us when we are gone? </p>
